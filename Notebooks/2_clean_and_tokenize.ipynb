The only thing that I like about it is that I have some familiarity with the system. Besides that, we keep encountering new problems with the software and the hardware. I've had 2 of my 6 brand new terminals replaced after they went bad and corrupted my whole system. It has not been good for business what so ever. \n",

I don't like how you are forced to use a reseller based on your territory. If our reseller isn't living up to our needs we would like to be able to get someone who can help.  You would also think with Aloha being the biggest POS the simple restaurant industry specific needs would be easy to obtain.  i.e. making sure payroll reports use the correct overtime rates, being able to do tips on checks without manual manipulation of reports etc\n",

We were told we could get 15 years out of our system and had to upgrade after 8. They have no solution for pay at the table with EMV as of now, and players like Oracle have already started releasing products of this magnitude. They also continue to blame our credit card processor for that, while the credit card processor says the same thing about Aloha.
